# Plane_Ticket_BookingApp
My university project.

Using plane flights informations included in text file, the programm allows the user to check all the departures, book any of them, choose airplane and print the whole ticket with those informations.

The project aim was to improve OOP and serialization skills, using copy and move constructors.
